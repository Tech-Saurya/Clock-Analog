# Clock-Analog
The analog clock is a digital representation of a traditional clock, implemented using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a circular dial representing the face of the clock, with hour, minute, and second hands rotating around a central point to indicate the current time.
